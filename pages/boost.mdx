Boost mode is very effective for producing a large number of new edited videos from a fixed video.

It is a unique system for those interested in affiliate marketing, dropshipping, etc. and those who want to produce conceptual content for social media.



## How Many

When Boost mode is activated, the "How Many" option appears on the screen.

This option determines the number of videos you want to produce.

You can transform the content of your products into any number of new content types using our content creation methods such as General Settings, 
Options and Custom, which we explain under the "Common" structure.

# Custom Design

If you want to decorate your videos with special designs, you can take advantage of this feature.

<video autoPlay muted loop controls>
  <source src="/özeltasarım.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


## Custom Video Settings

By default, your vertical videos take up the entire frame.

However, with the custom design option, you can overcome this rule and place your videos on the screen in any size you want.

### Main Video Settings

To show your main video in the frame in the desired dimensions and position, respectively;

**Width, Height, X Coordinate and Y Coordinate** values can be entered here.


Ex : 500,750,0,225

### Merged Video Settings

When the **Options > Merge Video** feature is used, this option can be used to customise the resolution and positions of the merged video.

The operation logic is the same as the Main Video Settings.


## Custom Background

You can use this field to change the color or design of your frame.


### Type of Background

There are two background type options, Color and Image/Gif.


#### Color

When the color option is activated

options and

- Custom Color

option arises.

If you wish, you can use ready-made colors or you can use the Custom Color option. 
You can choose a different color for the background by using the HEX code of a color.


#### Image/Gif

If you want to define an image or gif to your background instead of a fixed color, you can use this field.


After adding the vertical image/gif you want to define to the background to a folder, you can integrate it into the system via this option.

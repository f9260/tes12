If we want our logo to be included in our works, we can apply this process through the Add Logo option.

When it is checked, there will be 3 options: a field for adding logo, logo settings and logo opacity.


## Logo Settings

You can determine the size and position of the logo you added from this field.

You must enter **Width, Height, X Coordinate, Y Coordinate** values respectively (Ex: 100,150,50,200).



## Logo Opacity Setting

You can use this field to make your logo transparent.

A value of 9 provides the clearest image. As 1 value is approached, the image becomes transparent.

# Add Sound

If we want to use external audio in our videos, we can use the Add Audio feature to accomplish this.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only audio files with the .mp3 extension can be integrated.
</Callout>


We can add our audio file by adding it to a folder and defining the folder in the system, then we can add the desired sound to the videos.

# Merge Video

When the Merge Video option is enabled, new videos can be integrated into the content to be produced.

It has a similar structure to the Sync feature in the Hit Gun system.

<video autoPlay muted loop controls>
  <source src="/videobirlestir.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Video to Merge

You can define the videos you want to combine with the content to be produced here.

Scenes will be used according to the settings you specify in the Duration Setting.

## Duration Setting

There are three different duration settings, Default, Random and Custom Duration.

### Default

The default duration setting starts at the 10th second of the merged video. The main reason for this is the possibility of an intro in the combined video.

In order to directly merge the content, the merging process starts from the 10th second.

### Random

Starts the merging process from a random duration of the merged video.

For example, if you choose to use a 40-minute video as the merged video, the merging will start from different durations of the merged video for each video being worked on.


### Custom Duration

This is the field where you can enter the start time of the merged video.

For example, if you enter 20, the merging process starts from the 20th second of the merged video.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The custom duration is entered in seconds.
</Callout>


## Main Video Position

As with the `Hit Gun/Sync` structure, the main video position can be changed in the **Merge Video** structure.

Unlike the Sync structure, there are also left and right options here.

In other words, the main video can be on the top, bottom, left or right.


## Main Video Ration

Determines the proportion of the main video in the frame.

The default is 70%.

## Merged Video Opacity

The opacity of the merged video is set here. If you want your video to become transparent, you can enable this setting and adjust the opacity.

The higher the number entered, the higher the clarity, the lower the transparency.

## Use Merged Video Sound

Created videos have the main video audio by default.

If you want to use the audio of the merged video, you can enable this setting.

# Resource


<Image src={kaynak} />


This is the section where the content to be edited is identified.

It contains three options: **Videos**, **URL**, and **URL List**.

## Videos

If we want to perform editing with videos from our computer, we use this option.

Videos are added to a folder, and the folder is defined in the system with this option.


## URL

URL is a feature associated with the **Hit Gun** mode, along with URL List.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It can only be used for YouTube videos.
</Callout>


The link to the YouTube video we want to work with is defined in the system from this section.


## URL List

If we want to process multiple YouTube videos simultaneously, we use URL List.

After adding the links one below the other in a notepad, the notepad is defined in the system.

 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

In Hit Gun mode, there is a sequence of operations for using resources.

</Callout>


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

If URL List is active, the system disregards other options and attempts to operate through URL List.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

If URL List is passive, the operation proceeds based on the URL. If no link is defined in the URL, the Videos option is used.

</Callout>


## Proxy

<Image src={proxy} />

If you want to use the URL feature with Proxy, you can enable the Proxy option.


### Proxy List


To use the proxy feature, a notepad containing your proxies must be defined to the system from the **Proxy List** option.


### Proxy Static Username

If you have a proxy that connects with username and password and all your proxies have the same user and password defined, you can enter your username in this field.


### Proxy Static Password

If all your proxies have the same password, you can enter it in this field.



### Proxy Rules


- Proxy type must be **Http**. Https or Socks5 proxies are not supported.

- If you have many proxies with different users and passwords, you should enter them in the notepad as 

`IP`:`Port`:`Username`:`Password`.

If you have the same user and password, you can only enter 

`IP`:`Port` in the notepad.

You can enter your username and password in **Proxy Static Username** and **Proxy Static Password** fields.

If you do not have any username and password, just define 

`IP`:`Port`.


- Proxies should be listed one below the other in the notepad.

E.g :

<Image src={proxy2} />


- Available proxies are used in a randomized way. For each run a random proxy is selected from the list. 

- It is recommended to add at least 10 http proxy types for proxy usage.

Before starting an actual rendering process, you can use the Fast Test feature to create an overview of the result.

In this way, you can run your tests and save time until the desired output is created.


## Fast Test Setting

There are two fast test settings. 

### Show the first seconds of the result

This test setting produces video only for the first seconds of the result.

There are two separate options as the first 15 seconds and the first 30 seconds.

### Show as image

When checked, it takes an image from a random moment of the result and shows it.

Especially if you have used images, logos, etc., it may be preferred to use them to make sure that they are positioned as you wish.

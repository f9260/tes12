The interval method allows for work to be done on entered time intervals.

It has two sub-modes: **Random** and **Regular**.

## Random
When the Random mode is active, content production is carried out within the entered time intervals for the number of productions written in the "**How Many**" section.

###Example
Settings for a 40-minute YouTube video are as follows:

<Image src={metotaralikrastgele} />


| URL | youtube.com/video-id |
| :----- | :----: |
| How Many| 3 |
| Intervals | ```2:14-3:21```,```6:16-9:19```,```17:21-24:18```,```34:13-39:21```    |
| Video Duration/Fixed | 15 |
| Method | Interval/Random |


#### Result


| Intervals | Number of Produced Videos |
| :----- | :----: |
| 2:14-3:21 | 3 |
| 6:16-9:19 | 3 |
| 17:21-24:18 | 3 |
| 34:13-39:21 | 3 |


For each time interval, a total of 3 videos of 15 seconds each are randomly produced.

At the end of this process, we have a total of **12 videos**.


## Regular

When the Regular option is active, content production occurs for **all** entered time intervals.

### Example

Let's continue with a few minor changes to the example provided above.

Here are the settings for a 40-minute YouTube video:

| URL | youtube.com/video-id |
| :----- | :----: |
| Intervals | ```2:14-3:21```,```6:16-9:19```,```17:21-20:18```,```34:13-36:21```    |
| Video Duration/Fixed | 45 |
| Method | Interval/Regular  |


#### Result


| Intervals | Production Periods | Number of Produced Videos |
| :----- | :----: | :----: |
| 2:14-3:21 | ```2:14-2:59```,```2:59-3:44``` | 2 |
| 6:16-9:19 | ```6:16-7:01```,```7:01-7:46```,```7:46-8:31```,```8:31-9:16```,```9:16-10:01``` | 5 |
| 17:21-20:18 | ```17:21-18:06```,```18:06-18:51```,```18:51-19:34```,```19:34-20:19``` | 4 |
| 34:13-36:21 | ```34:13-34:58```,```34:58-35:43```,```35:43-36:28``` | 3 |



As seen, different numbers of contents were created for different time intervals.

Each created content is 45 seconds long.

When the duration of the last content exceeds the entered time interval, content production is terminated.

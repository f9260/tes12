# Sync

Allows the target video to be integrated into the vertical video produced.

If checked;

**Main Video Position** - **Main Video Ratio** - **Merged Area**

options arise.

</video>



## Main Video Position

Main video refers to the vertical video produced.

The main video position has two options, **Top** and **Bottom**.

By default, the Top option is selected and the main video is at the top of the produced content.

When the Main Video Position is marked as Bottom, the Sync video moves to the top and the main video is at the bottom.


## Main Video Ratio

The main video ratio refers to the space that the main video occupies on the split screen.

By default, this ratio is 70. 70 means 70%.

The remaining 30% is occupied by the merging video.


## Merged Area

Specifies the area to be covered by the synchronised video.

There are two options, **Default (100%)** and **Advanced**.


### Default(100%)

The entire target video is integrated.


<Image src={esitle} width={425} height={600} />



### Advanced

If you want to integrate a part of the target video instead of the whole video, you can use the advanced option.

If the **Advanced** option is selected, two ``Merged Custom Area Type`` named **Percent** and **Pixel** will appear.


#### Merged Custom Area: Percent

The working principle is the same as the structure we explained under the title [Area > Advanced > Custom Area Type: Percent](area/advanced#custom-area-type-percent).


It allows us to select the desired area from the synchronised video with percentage ratios.

#### Merged Custom Area: Pixel

The working principle is the same as the structure we explained under the title [Area > Advanced > Custom Area Type: Percent](area/advanced#custom-area-type-pixel).


It allows the area to be selected from the target video to be selected with pixels.

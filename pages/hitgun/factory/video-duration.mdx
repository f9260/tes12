# Video Duration

This is the section where the duration settings of the generated videos are adjusted.

There are two different options: **Fixed** and **Flex**.



<video autoPlay muted loop controls>
  <source src="/fabrika-süre.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>



## Fixed

When checked, contents are generated with the entered value length.

For example, when 30 is entered, each generated content will be 30 seconds long.


## Flex

It selects a **random value** from the range of values entered in **Min Duration** and **Max Duration** and generates content with this value length.


For example, let's say **Min Duration** is set to "```30``", **Max Duration** is set to "``200``" and the system chooses the value **142** among these values. 

**The length of the video will be 142 seconds.

There are two different rendering options: CPU and GPU.

When GPU is checked, the rendering process proceeds through the video card.

It supports Nvidia and Amd video cards.


## Quality


When the GPU option is selected, there are two quality options, High and Good.

You can select High to get better quality videos
but the rendering process may take a little longer compared to Good.

  In cases where your system power is insufficient, video loss may occur. It is therefore advisable to monitor the content produced when using the "Rapid" and "Blistering" options.
  If you experience losses, you can choose lower speeds.

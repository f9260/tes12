## Language

The language option includes Sub Mod. Here, the mode of our subtitle is determined.

### Video Lang

When the Video Language option is activated, subtitles are created only in the original language of the video used.


### Another Lang


This feature is used to translate the original language into subtitles in a different language.

The actual language of the video is determined in the **Source Video - Lang** section.

In the **Target - Lang** section, the subtitle language to be produced is selected.


## Design

If we want to customize our subtitles, we can use the **Design** option.


### Font

We can use it to show our subtitles with different fonts.


### Font Size

This is the area where we can set the size of the subtitles. In addition to a few fixed values, there is also a section where you can specify a custom size.

### Font Color

You can change the subtitle colour here.



### Shadow

If you want to create your subtitles on a black area instead of creating them directly, you can activate the Shadow option.

When the Black option is selected, subtitles are created directly on a black print.

When the Transparent option is selected, the subtitles are rendered on a transparent black area.


## Choose Position

This is the area where you can set the location of your subtitles. 

In addition to the positions suggested by the system, you can specify a custom position, enter the coordinates and display your subtitles wherever you want.

**Regular** ve **Random** olmak üzere iki adet viral modu bulunmaktadır.


## Regular Mod

If you want to produce content with fixed durations, this mode will meet your needs.


**For example**

Let 4 scenes of the sound file you are using be specified with durations `4.1`, `2.3`, `3.6`, `1.9`.

For these 4 scenes, you wanted to produce content by using video footage 
from the minutes **14:13**, **21:36**, **33:17** and **38:11** of a 40-minute video.



**In this case** 

The ``first scene`` starts at **14:13** minutes and continues until ``(+4.1)``**14:17.1**.

The ``second scene`` starts at **21:36** minutes and continues until ``(+2.3)``**21:38.3**.

The ``third scene`` starts at **33:17** minutes and continues until ``(+3.6)``**33:20.6**.

The ``last scene`` starts at **38:11** minutes and continues until ``(+1.9)``**38:12.9**.



A new content is created from the video images obtained with the relevant audio file.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In Regular mode, only the time is entered. Like 14:11, 21:16, 1:27:19.
</Callout>


## Random Mod

When Random mode is activated, random scenes are selected from the time intervals you enter and a new video is created with this content.


**For example**

Let 4 scenes of the sound file you are using be specified with durations `4.1`, `2.3`, `3.6`, `1.9`.

For these 4 scenes, you wanted to produce content using video footage between **5-13**, **14-18**, **21-27** and **31-36** minutes of a 40-minute video.


In this case, random durations are selected from the entered time intervals and the relevant scene productions are performed starting from these durations.


The ``first scene`` starts at **7:25** minutes and continues until ``(+4.1)``**7:29.1**.

The ``second scene`` starts at **16:13** minutes and continues until ``(+2.3)``**16:15.3**.

The ``third scene`` starts at **24:12** minutes and continues until ``(+3.6)``**24:15.6**.

The ``last scene`` starts at **33:28** minutes and continues until ``(+1.9)``**33:29.9**.


etc.

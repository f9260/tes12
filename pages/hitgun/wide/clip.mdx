# Clip


When activated, it generates a single video from the content generated from the duration settings in the Methods under the Factory feature.


There are two different clip types, **Regular** and **Random**.



## Regular

In Regular mode, content is produced in the same order as it is produced in the methods.


## Random

In the random clip type, content is generated in random order from the content generated by the methods.



## Clip Intro/Outro

This feature is used if you want to create intro and outro for the clips produced.

 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The file names to be used as intro and outro should be written as " **intro** " and " **outro** ". 
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The file containing this content must not contain any other files.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you want to use only " **Intro** ", there should be a file named ```intro```; if you want to use " **Outro** ", there should be a file named ```outro```.
</Callout>


## Custom Clip

You can use this option if you want to produce a clip from the videos on your computer.

Simply place your videos in a folder and define the folder to the system.

Using the Random and Regular option, you can determine the order of your content in the new content to be created.

# Transition


When producing a clip, you may want to add transitions between the videos used.

The Transition feature will fulfill this need.

If checked;

**Transition Type** - **Start Over** - **Transitions**

3 options are formed as above.


## Transition Type

There are two transition types, Regular and Random.

### Regular

In a Regular transition, the transition videos you create are added to the content in a sequence.



### Random

In Random transition, your transitions are completely randomized and inserted between videos.


## First

Transitions are added between videos by default.

However, in some cases, you may want to add your transition before the video.

In such moments, you can check the "First" option to start your video with your transition content first.


## Transitions

This is the area where you will define the video of your transitions to the system.

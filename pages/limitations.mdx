# Limitations

There are 4 modes in the VE3.Plus system, **Single, Multi, Boost** and **Hit Gun**, and many sub-modes under the **Hit Gun** mode.

While the sub-modes work stably within themselves, tests are ongoing to ensure that they work in harmony with the features of other sub-modes and common features.

For this reason, the use of features under testing is currently blocked.

You can follow the features that are in the testing phase and the completed tests at [Forum/Test](https://forum.ve3.plus/p/1-test).

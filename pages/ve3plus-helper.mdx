### Interval Mode

When you want to use the [Factory > Method > Interval](https://ve3.plus/hitgun/factory/method/interval) method, you can use the Interval Mode option. 


Since only minute and hour intervals are specified in Interval Mode, only minute and hour intervals are specified when Interval Mode is enabled in our VE3.Plus-Helper system.
